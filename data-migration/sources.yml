    Publica opera plurima [Augustus] exstruxit, e quibus vel
    praecipua: forum cum aede Martis Ultoris, templum Apollinis in
    Palatio, aedem Tonantis lovis in Capitolio. Fori exstruendi causa fuit
    hominum et iudiciorum multitudo, quae videbatur non sufficientibus

    deducerentur, quique victores redissent, huc insignia triumphorum

  english: |-
    Augustus constructed numerous public works, among which the
    following are perhaps the most outstanding: his forum with its temple
    of Mars the Avenger, the temple of Apollo on the Palatine, and the
    temple of Jupiter the Thunderer on the Capitoline.
    Augustus built his forum because the two existing forums could
    no longer accommodate the increasing number of people and law cases,
    so that a third was thought necessary. Because of this need for space it
    was opened for business even before the temple was finished, and it
    was stipulated that the new forum be the venue for public trials as well
    as the selection of jurors by lot. He had vowed the temple to Mars
    during the battle at Philippi, which he fought to avenge the death of
    his father Julius Caesar. He decreed, therefore, that the Senate use the
    forum to deliberate on war and the awarding of triumphs, that those
    heading off to provinces with military command be officially escorted
    from here, and that those who returned victorious should deposit the
    insignia of their triumphs in his forum.

    Tarquinius Priscus [ruling 616-578 BC] undertook the construction
    of a temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, which he had vowed to
    the gods during his last battle against the Sabines. The hill on which he
    planned to place the temple needed a great deal of preparation, being
    neither accessible nor level, but rather precipitous and sharply peaked.
    Tarquinius surrounded the hill with high retaining walls and filled in
    the space between these walls and the summit to create a level platform
    able to support temples. He died, however, before he was able to
    lay the foundation for the Temple of Jupiter, outliving the end of the
    war by only four years. Many years later, Tarquinius Superbus, the second
    king after him (the one who was deposed) laid the foundations
    and built much of the structure, though he too did not complete it. . . .
    The Romans finished the Temple of Jupiter [in 507 BC] in the
    third consulship of the Republic. Built on a high podium, the perimeter
    of the temple is 800 feet. Each of its sides is about 200 feet; in fact,
    the length of the temple does not exceed the width by a full fifteen
    feet. Although rebuilt a generation ago after it burnt down [in 83 BC],
    it rests on the same foundations and differs from the old temple only
    in the costliness of its materials. The front of the temple, towards the
    south,. has three rows of columns; there is a single row of columns
    down each side. Inside there are three chambers, although they are
    under one pediment and one roof. Each of the side chambers-one for
    Juno, and one for Minerva-shares a wall with the center one, which is
    dedicated to Jupiter.

The first hall was sixty feet long, and contained three of the world's most incredible and famous works of art: the lampstand, the table, and the incense altar. The lampstand, which branched into seven lamps, symbolized the seven planets; the twelve loaves of bread [the \"Shew-Bread,\" or \"Bread of Presence\"] on the table represented the circle of the Zodiac and the year; the altar of incense is kept replenished with thirteen aromatic incenses collected from both land and sea, and from places both inhabited and deserted, thus symbolizing that all creation is of God and for God."

    [Belisarius, the emperor Justinian's famous general, defeated the Vandals in Africa in AD 534, and returned to Constantinople, now the capital of the Roman empire.] When he reached Constantinople with his captive Vandals and their king Gelimer, he was awarded honors given to the greatest Roman generals of old-honors which for nearly six hundred years had not been granted to anyone except emperors, such as Titus and Trajan and other victorious emperors who warred against the barbarian peoples. Belisarius displayed both the booty and the enslaved captives of the war in a procession that the Romans call a triumph. . . . Many thousands of pounds of silver were paraded, as well as the entire imperial treasury of Rome which the Vandals under Gaiseric had plundered [in AD 455] from the Palatine when they sacked the city, as I mentioned earlier [in Book. 3.5.3]. Among the booty were the treasures of the Jews, which Titus, the son of Vespasian, and others had brought to Rome after the sack of Jerusalem, 
    As the triumphal procession went by, one of the Jews standing alongside an imperial official said to him, "The Romans, I predict, will come to regret taking this plunder of Jerusalem into the palace in Constantinople: these objects belong in one place only, where Solomon placed them long ago when he was king of the Jews. That is why Gaiseric was able to sack the palace of Rome, and why the army of the Romans has now captured the Vandals." When his words were relayed to the emperor, Justinian quickly had the Jewish treasure delivered to Christian sanctuaries in Jerusalem.

    Cicero sends greetings to Atticus: [54 BC]
    Nothing is more impressive than Paullus's new basilica, nothing more suited to advance a reputation. And so, I must confess, we "friends of Caesar" (I refer to myself and Oppius, even if that causes you to explode) have spent without any qualms sixty million sesterces towards that monumental work you used to praise so highly the expansion of the overcrowded Forum, and its extension all the way to the Atrium of Liberty. The private owners of the land would not have sold for a lesser sum. But the results of our efforts will be magnificent, since we also have in mind to reconstruct the Voting Pens [Saepta] for the tribal assemblies in the Campus Martius, this one made of marble and roofed over, and we will surround it with a lofty colonnade a mile long. The Villa Publica will be attached to it as part of the same project. I know you're probably wondering what possible advantage I get out of these show-pieces, but let's not go into that now.

Hadrian then had the features of Nero removed (the statue's original dedicatee) and consecrated it instead to the Sun-god, which he planned to accompany later with a colossus of the Moon designed by Apollodorus.

  english: "[The festival called the Lupercalia derives its name from the she-wolf (lupa) story.] We see that the course that the Luperci run around the city begins where Romulus was left to die as an infant. The rites of the Lupercalia, however, rather obscure this connection, since the priests sacrifice not wolves but goats, after which some of them touch the bloodied sacrificial knives to the foreheads of two young men of noble birth, who are required to laugh when others wipe the blood away with wool soaked in milk. After this ceremony, they cut the goat-skins into strips, and clad in nothing but these they run through the city using the swags of goat-skin to lash people along the course. Women of child-bearing age make no effort to avoid the contact, believing it promotes fertility and an easy delivery. In another peculiarity of the ritual, the Luperci sacrifice a dog."

    At that time [in 205 BC] a sudden religious fear overtook the Romans when, after the frequent volcanic showers of stone that year, they consulted the Sibylline books and found an oracle stating that any foreign enemy who attacked Italy could be driven out of Italy and defeated only if the Mother of Mt. Ida was brought to Rome from Pessinus. ... The Roman ambassadors went to King Attalus of Pergamum, who received them kindly and led them to Pessinus in Phrygia [central Turkey]. There he presented them with the sacred stone that the natives say is the Mother of the Gods, and he invited the Romans to take it back to Rome. 
    
    When the ship carrying the Mother of Mt. Ida approached the mouth of the Tiber [in 204 BC], Publius Cornelius Scipio sailed out, as required, to the offshore waters to receive the goddess from her priests, and he brought her in to the shore where the leading matrons of Rome were waiting to receive the goddess. (Among these women the name of the Vestal Quinta Claudia is conspicuous, since her help in bringing the goddess to Rome caused her reputation for purity, until then apparently under some suspicion, to shine into posterity.) Passing the stone hand to hand in unbroken succession, the women sent the sacred stone on its way to Rome. The entire city poured out to watch. Incense-burners were placed at the doorways of homes all along the route, and when the stone passed, they lit incense and prayed that the goddess would enter Rome willingly and look upon them favorably. The matrons brought her to the Temple of Victory on the Palatine on April 12, her holy day, and a crowd of people brought the goddess 
    gifts; a banquet for the gods was held, as well as games called the Megalesia.

Every year the praetors perform sacrifices and hold games in her honor, in accordance with Roman customs, but both the priest and priestess of the goddess are Phrygians, and they are the ones who parade her image through the city, begging alms in the Mother's name as is their custom, wearing images around their chests, beating on drums and accompanied by the ritual flute music of their followers. By custom and a decree of the Senate, no native Roman begs alms for Cybele or parades to flute music in multi-colored robes or worships the goddess with ecstatic Phrygian rites.

He gave out orders that the exceptionally revered and beautiful statues of deities, such as the Jupiter at Olympia, were to be brought to Rome from Greece, decapitated, and supplied with a head of his own likeness. He also extended a part of the Palatine palace all the way out to the Forum, transforming the Temple of Castor and Pollux into an entrance hall for the Palace. There in the temple he would often take his seat between the twin gods, presenting himself for worship to those who approached. Some even greeted him as Jupiter Latiaris, [a form of Jupiter worshipped on Mt. Albanus]. 
    On clear nights when the Moon was full, he would welcome the lunar deity into his bed with passionate embraces, but by day he had private words with Jupiter Capitolinus, and would whisper in the god's ear or put his own ear to Jupiter's lips. At times he would raise his voice and even quarrel with the god: once he was heard to quote Homer in threatening tones, "Either you move me, or I move you ..!" Finally Caligula announced that he had been won over by Jupiter's entreaties to live together. He then built a bridge above the Temple of the Deified Augustus to connect the Palatine and the Capitoline, and soon laid the foundations of a new house near the Temple of Jupiter.

    The first Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, which was built by

    credit for its dedication. This temple was likewise totally destroyed,
    this time in the rebellion of Vitellius [in AD 69], after which Vespasian
    began and finished the construction of a third temple. . . Shortly after
    Vespasian died the Capitoline burned down again [in AD 80].
    The fourth and present temple was both built and dedicated by
    Domitian [in AD 891. ... Even the gilding alone of this temple's roof,
    costing more than 12,000 talents, is beyond the means of the richest
    private citizen in Rome today. Its columns were cut from Pentelic marble
    and were originally of beautiful proportions, as I saw for myself in
    Athens. When they were shaped and polished in Rome, however, they

    war against the Sabines; he too laid the foundations of it, on a scale
    that accorded more with the hope of future greatness than with the
    modest means available to the Roman people at that time. Soon Servius
    Tullius, with the aid of allies, and then Tarquinius Superbus, with spoils
    gained from the capture of Suessa Pometia, constructed the building.
    The honor of the work, however, was reserved for liberty, since only
    after the kings were expelled did Horatius Pulvillus dedicate the temple
    in his second consulship; since that time the immense wealth of the
    Roman people has ornamented the temple's magnificence more than
    it has increased it. After it burnt down 415 years later in the consulship
    of L. Scipio and C. Norbanus, the temple was rebuilt on the same footprint.
    The victorious Sulla undertook the task of reconstruction, but
    did not dedicate the new temple (in this alone Fortune failed him),
    and the name of Lutatius Catulus endured among all the great monuments
    of Caesars down to the time of Vitellius.
    Vespasian assigned the work of restoring the Capitolium to Lucius
    Vestinus, a man of the equestrian class but among the leading men for
    his authority and prestige. The haruspices employed by him warned
    that the remains of the earlier temple should be carried away to the
    swamps and that the new temple should have the same dimensions as
    before: the gods did not want the old plan changed.

    [After the fire had destroyed the temple,] the Emperor Vespasian
    himself played an active role in the restoration of the Capitoline.
    He was the first person to begin the task of clearing away the rubble,
    carrying off a load of it on his own shoulders. In addition, he undertook
    the reproduction of three thousand bronze tablets that had also
    been destroyed in the fire, after a thorough search for other copies.
    These tablets were very old and precious documents of Roman rule,
    containing decrees of the Senate and votes of the people concerning
    alliances, treaties, and privileges granted at anytime to anyone, dating
    back almost to the beginning of the city.

  english: |-
    [The Gauls of northern Italy descended on Rome in 390 BC] Since
    there was no hope of defending the city from the Gauls with the small
    force now left to them, the Romans resolved that the young men of
    military age as well as the able-bodied senators would withdraw with
    their wives and children to the Citadel and the Capitoline; from this
    fortification, after stocking it with weapons and provisions, they might
    defend the gods, the people, and the name of Rome. . . .
    While Camillus was being appointed general by Romans in nearby
    Veii, the Citadel of Rome and the Capitolium fell into grave danger:
    the Gauls had found the footprints of the messenger from Veii who
    had made it through their lines, or perhaps had noticed on their own
    that the cliffs by the shrine of Carmentis favored an attempt there [by
    the Tiber, above the Temple of Fortuna at S. Omobono]. On a moonless
    night the Gauls sent up a few unarmed men to scout out a path,
    and then began their climb. Handing weapons up to others at the steep
    spots and bracing themselves on men below or bracing others in turn,
    they pushed and pulled their way up the mountain as the terrain
    demanded. They gained the summit so quietly that they not only
    escaped the detection of the watchmen but of the dogs as well, a
    creature attuned to nocturnal noise.
    They did not, however, escape the notice of the geese on the hill.
    Because the geese were sacred to Juno, the besieged Romans, even when
    running out of food, had refrained from killing them. This religious
    observance proved to be Rome's salvation, for the sacred geese created
    such a uproar by honking and flapping their wings that they woke up
    Marcus Manlius, an outstanding soldier who had been consul three
    years earlier. Manlius grabbed his weapons and dashed outside, shouting
    for help. While other men hesitated in fear, Manlius dislodged a
    Gaul, just then reaching the summit, with one blow of his shield and
    sent him tumbling onto the men below. Terrified, the other attackers
    dropped their weapons and clung to the rock with both hands while
    Manlius went in for the kill. Soon other defenders joined him and
    routed the enemy with javelins and loose rocks, and the attack collapsed
    in total disaster for the Gauls as they were driven headlong from
    the cliffs. . . .
    [After the Gauls withdrew from Rome, the general Camillus gave
    a passionate speech to dissuade the Roman people from turning their
    backs on the charred ruins of Rome and resettling elsewhere: "Romans,
    do not abandon your city.] Here, and nowhere else, stands the
    Capitoiium; it was here that the buried human head (capite) was discovered
    and judged an omen that the Capitoline would one day be the
    head of the world and the summit of an empire; here is the ground
    that, to the joy of your ancestors, the god of Youth and the god of
    Borders refused to abandon when the Capitolium was being
    deconsecrated with augural rites to make room for Jupiter."

    (After turning the tide of battle against the Latins, the Roman
    army was victorious.] During this battle, it is said, two horsemen appeared
    to the Roman commander Postumius and the men fighting
    around him. In beauty and size far outstripping the mortal norm and
    just beginning to grow a beard, the two led a charge of the Roman
    cavalry. Using their spears, they drove all the Latins they met into flight
    After the Latins retreated and the Romans sacked their camp
    (which occurred in the late afternoon), they say that there appeared in
    the Roman Forum, at just about the same time, two young men, striking
    in their size and beauty and likewise in early manhood, dressed in
    battle gear and with the look of battle still fresh in their faces, leading
    horses that were drenched in sweat. After they watered and washed
    down their horses at the spring which wells up into a small but deep
    pool next to the Temple of Vesta, they told the crowd, which had gathered
    around them and were eager for news of the battle, how the battle
    had gone and that the Romans had won. Then the two left the Forum
    and were not seen again, despite an intensive search by the official left
    in charge of the city. The next day, when the officials in town received
    letters from the field describing the battle and in particular the epiphany
    of the heavenly spirits, they concluded that they had seen a vision of
    the same gods at the spring, identifying them (as seems reasonable) as
    apparitions of the Dioscuri twins, Castor and Pollux.
    There are many memorials in Rome to this strange and marvelous
    epiphany. They include the Temple to Castor and Pollux that the
    city built in the Roman Forum on the site where the apparitions
    appeared, and the fountain next to it likewise named after the two
    deities and considered sacred to this day . . . . But the most spectacular
    observance occurs after the sacrifice at this temple, when all those who
    own a horse for military service ride in procession, grouped in rows by
    tribe and century .. . .The horsemen, as many as five thousand of them,
    ride through the Forum and past the Temple of Castor and Pollux,
    wearing whatever insignia their commanders have awarded them for
    bravery in battle. This parade is a stunning expression of the power of
    Roman rule.

    [When Verres, one of the most corrupt politicians ever produced
    by Rome, was praetor,] he wanted the Temple of Castor and Pollux to
    be the most famous memorial of his corruption, something we would
    not just hear about occasionally but be able to see on a daily basis.
    He asked who was responsible for turning over the Temple of Castor in
    a state of good repair, and learned that it was the son of the late Junius,
    who was still a minor. He was also told that the statuary and gifts to
    the temple were all accounted for, and that the temple itself was in fine
    condition all around. For someone such as Venes, it seemed a shame if
    such a large and magnificent temple should go unused to make himself
    richer, especially at the expense of a minor.
    So Verres personally goes to inspect the temple. He sees that the
    ceiling is beautifully paneled everywhere and that everything else was
    maintained in good order. Verres turns and asks one of the dogs in his
    pack of followers what he could possibly do with the place, and is told:
    "Verres, there's nothing here for you to work on, unless you want to
    put the columns on the perpendicular." "'On the perpendicular?"' this
    most incompetent of humans asks; "What does that mean?" They tell
    him that no column can be set exactly on the perpendicular. "By Hercules,
    that's what we'll do then: these columns must be realigned on
    the perpendicular! "
    All those columns that we see there, freshly whitened, were taken
    down with a scaffold-prop in their place, and then put back up using
    the very same stone as before. For this work, Verres, you accepted a bid
    of 560,000 sesterces. Furthermore, your contractor never even touched
    some of the columns, but simply scraped and re-coated them!

    [While Camillus held the post of dictator, conflict arose between

    the creation of a plebeian consulship. Emotions on both sides grew
    heated, leading to a near-riot in the Forum.] Not sure what to do in
    this crisis, Camillus did not renounce his dictatorship but gathered the
    senators together and proceeded to the Senate House. Before going in,
    however, he turned to the Capitoline and prayed, calling on the gods
    to steer the present events toward some happy conclusion and vowing
    to build a temple to Concord if the conflict subsided.
    Inside, the Senate hotly debated the issue, but the moderates prevailed
    and they conceded to the Plebs the right to elect one of the
    two consuls from their own number. When the dictator went out
    and announced this as the will of the Senate, the people expressed
    their approval immediately, as might be expected, happy to be reconciled
    with the Senate, and they escorted Camillus home to cheering
    and applause.
    On the next day the people met in assembly and voted to build
    the Temple to Concord that Camillus had vowed, oriented to face the

    [Calendar entry for January 16:]
    Radiant goddess, today you moved to your snow-white temple
    Where lofty Juno lifts her steps high up the hill.
    Here you can oversee, Concordia, the Latin crowds
    Now that sacred hands have performed your dedication.
    Camillus, famed for his Etruscan conquests, vowed
    The original temple, and carried out the vow he'd sworn
    When the People revolted and took up arms against the Senate
    And Rome had cause to fear the force of its own aggression.
    The recent temple's cause is better; the Germans bowed
    Their shaggy heads beneath your rule, Tiberius,
    And with the booty of this conquest that earned you a triumph
    You built a temple to honor a goddess special to you.

    the Praetorian Guards, was suspected of treason and arrested] he was
    thrown into the Prison. [AD 31] Later that same day, however, the

    And spaced around the altar, looking almost alive, Four bulls from the famous hand of Myron stand. Then, in the middle, a temple of radiant marble rises, 
    A home more dear to the god than Delos itself. 
    The chariot of the Sun is upon its pediment. The doors are Libyan ivory, finely wrought, 
    One door lamenting the Gauls tossed from the peak of Pamassus,

    [Claudius, the uncle of Caligula, was long the object of jokes and humiliation. But when Caligula was assassinated in a conspiracy of centurions and tribunes,] Claudius, at the age of fifty, became emperor in the strangest manner imaginable. 
    When the conspirators had killed Caligula and were dispersing the crowd by pretending that the emperor was still alive and just wanted to be alone, Claudius, excluded along with the others, withdrew into a summer room called the Hermaeum. A short time later he heard a report that Caligula had been murdered. In terror, Claudius slipped outside to a balcony off the Hermaeum, concealing himself behind the curtains that hung across the doorway. By chance, one of the rank-and-file wandering around the Palace saw his feet slicking out from under the curtain. Checking to see who it was, the soldier recognized Claudius and pulled him inside. As Claudius fell to his knees in fear, the soldier hailed him emperor. 
    The soldier led Claudius back to his fellow soldiers, who were still raging and roaming about without a plan. They placed Claudius on a litter, and since his own litter-bearers had run off, they took turns carrying him back to the [Praetorian] Camp. ... But on the following day, while the Senate delayed out of weariness and disagreement over what should be done next, and while the crowd that had gathered outside demanded a single ruler and shouted for Claudius by name, Claudius allowed the soldiers to assemble in arms to swear an oath of allegiance to him. Claudius also paid them 15,000 sesterces each (becoming the first of the Caesars to secure the loyalty of troops with a cash payment).

    Granite from Egypt, blushing marbles, and sea-green stone;
    White slabs of Luna are relegated to the bases of columns.
    The ceiling is a distant view, and the eyes must strain to reach

    Of Rome to sup together with knights at a thousand tables.

As the time of suspected danger approached, he grew more anxious by the day and had the walls of the colonnades where he like to stroll covered with a veneer of moonstone, so that he could see in its polish the reflections of whatever was happening behind his back. 
    On the day of his death, when Domitian asked the time, one of the conspirators told him it was the sixth hour, knowing that Domitian feared the fifth. Thinking the danger past, Domitian happily hurried off to exercise and bathe, but was stopped along the way by his chamberlain Parthenius, who said someone had to see him about some weighty matter or other that couldn't be put off. And so Domitian, having dismissed his attendants, entered his bedroom, where he was killed.

    Ceterum Nero usus est pauiae minis exturxitque domum in

  english:  After the fire, Nero took personal advantage of his country's calamity and built himself a downtown residence. The cause for amazement was not so much its profusion of gems and gold (luxuries common enough by then) as its fields and ponds, with woods resembling a wilderness on one side and open spaces with vistas on the other. This was all designed and directed by Severus and Celer, who possessed both the talent and the audacity that were needed to create by art what nature herself refused, and to beguile away the resources at an emperor's disposal.

    For all Nero's extravagance elsewhere, nothing matched his wastefulness in building. He built a palace that stretched from the Palatine to the Esquiline, which he at first called the Passage House [Domus Transitoria]and then, after this was soon destroyed in the fire and re- built, renamed the Golden House [Domus Aurea].The following details will suffice to give an idea of its size and luxury. 
    In the forecourt of the Golden House stood a statue in the likeness of Nero 120 feet tall. The palace was so extensive that it had a 
    triple colonnade a mile long. A pond, in imitation of the sea, was bordered with buildings to look like cities. In addition there were various 
    types of countryside, with cropland, vineyards, pastures and woods, 
    plentifully stocked with all manner of wild and domestic creatures. 
    In the rest of the palace, everything was overlaid with gold and 
    adorned with gems and mother-of-pearl. The dining rooms had ceilings with ivory panels that swiveled aside so that pipes might shower 
    petals and perfume on banqueters below, and the main dining room 
    had a dome that revolved day and night like the heavens. The baths 
    flowed with waters from the sea and the Albulan sulfur springs [near 
    Tivoli]. When Nero dedicated the palace constructed in such a fashion, 
    he simply expressed his approval by saying, "Finally a home fit for a human being."

    painting and sculpture. In fact, into that one sacred precinct were
    gathered and stationed all the art-works that people had been willing
    to travel the world over to see, even when they were scattered.
    Vespasian also proudly kept here the works of gold taken from the

    the inner temple be kept safely in the palace.

    On a trip to Rome once, I heard the following story from a
    Roman senator. He said that it took place when the Gothic king Atalaric,
    grandson of Theoderic the Great, was ruling in Italy [c. AD 530]. Late in
    the day a herd of cattle came into Rome from the countryside and was
    passing through the square that the Romans call the Forum of Peace
    because of the Temple of Peace that is located there (now damaged by
    lightning). At the front of the forum there is an old fountain on which
    a bronze bull stands, a work of Pheidias, I believe, or perhaps Lysippus.
    ... (This forum also contains Myron's Calf; the ancient Romans were
    eager collectors of the best of Greece's art and displayed it with great
    pride.)
    One of the passing cattle-a gelded steer, the senator said-left
    the herd and climbing onto the fountain mounted the bronze bull
    By chance, at the same time a man was passing, an Etruscan by birth,
    who understood the import of this scene (for even down to my day the
    Etruscans are skilled in the art of prophecy): one day, he prophesied, a
    eunuch would bring down the ruler of Rome. ... [And in truth it
    was the general Narses, an imperial eunuch, who defeated the
    Gothic king Totila.]

    mounted by Trajan, was located in the center of the courtyard.
    Standing near him and hearing this, the prince Ormisdas responded

    before he fought Pompey at Pharsalus. He surrounded it with a space
    intended as a forum for the Romans, although not for commerce, but
    for the exercise of civic business (as in Persia, where people come to
    the forum to seek justice or to study the laws). Alongside the statue of

    Caesar's last will was displayed to the people assembled in the
    Forum, and they demanded that it be read immediately. In the will
    Caesar declared Octavius, the grandson of Caesar's sister, to be his
    adopted son. He also bequeathed his private garden to the people, and
    gave 75 drachmas to every Roman citizen living in the city. This began
    to stir some anger in the crowd against the conspirators. . . .
    Then Piso brought the corpse of Caesar into the Forum. A crowd
    swarmed around the body, giving it an armed escort to the Rostra with
    loud cries and a lavish procession. . . . Sensing the mood of the crowd,
    ... Antony spoke as follows:
    "Citizens, it would not be proper for me, a single individual, to
    deliver the eulogy for this great man; that is rather the duty of the
    entire country. I will therefore read to you all the decrees that the Senate
    and people, united in admiration, voted in praise of Caesar while
    he was alive, thereby giving voice not to Antony's sentiments, but to
    your own."
    With a sullen, gloomy expression on his face, Antony read aloud
    the decrees, giving special emphasis to those which voted Caesar into
    the ranks of gods by declaring him sacred and sacrosanct, or which
    pronounced him to be the father of his country, a great benefactor, a
    leader without equal. With each honor, Antony turned and gestured to
    the corpse. . . . Then he recited the oaths that the senators took to defend
    Caesar and his person with all their strength, and to avenge any
    conspiracy against him, or be damned. ...
    At the end of his speech, carried away by his emotions, Antony
    uncovered the body of Caesar and lifted the dead man's toga aloft,
    swaying it on the end of a spear so that all might see the gashes made
    by the daggers and the stains of the dictator's blood. Seeing this, the
    crowd keened like a chorus in a Greek tragedy, loudly joining Antony's
    expressions of grief. Once again, the emotions of lamentation aroused
    anger in them. . . .
    While the crowd was in this state and on the edge of violence,
    someone raised a wax image of Caesar above the bier (the body itself,
    being supine on the bier, could not be seen). This image, which a
    mechanical device continuously rotated, showed each of the 23 stab ounds
    that had been savagely delivered to all parts of Caesar's body
    as well as his face. At the sight of this the crowd could no longer endure
    their grief.... [After rioting around the city against the conspirators]
    the people returned to the body of Caesar and carried it up the
    Capitoline to bury it in the Temple of Jupiter and place him among the
    gods. Forbidden to do this by the priest, they returned to the Forum
    with the body and placed it next to the Regia, the old palace of the
    kings. Then gathering benches and other pieces of wood that the Forum is filled with, along with anything else they could lay their hands
    on, they heaped it around him in a pile . . . and set it on fire. A great
    crowd stayed and watched it burn through the night.
    The site of the pyre was first marked with an altar, but then the
    present temple was erected when Caesar was deemed worthy of divine
    honors. These were accorded him by Octavius, his son by adoption,
    who changed his name to Caesar and followed in his father's footsteps
    politically, greatly strengthening the rule which Julius Caesar founded
    and which continues to this day [c. AD 150]. Ever since this first divination,
    the Romans, who formerly could not tolerate that any living man
    should bear the title of king, continue to accord divine honors to each
    of the emperors upon his death, unless he has ruled in a cruel or tyrannical
    fashion.

After that he moved to the Palatine, but to the no less modest house of Hortensius, which was conspicuous for neither its size nor elegance, having short colonnades with columns of Alban tufa and rooms without marble or fancy flooring. Here he remained for more than forty years, sleeping in the same room both winters and summers, even though winters in Rome did not agree with his health and were hard on him. If he felt the need for doing business in secrecy or without interruption, he could withdraw to a special room elevated above the rest of the house, which he called either his "Syracuse" or "the Shop," or would take refuge in a nearby villa that belonged to one or another of his freedmen. If he was sick, however, he would convalesce at the home of Maecenas. During longer retreats, he frequented the coast and islands of the Bay of Naples or towns nearer Rome such as Lanuvium and Praeneste, as well as Tivoli, where he frequently held court under the colonnades of the Temple of Hercules.

    3 Romulus and Remus lived the life of herdsmen and earned their living with their hands. They lived for the most part on the hills, building huts entirely out of wooden poles and reeds. One of these huts survives even to my own day, preserved on the slope of the Palatine facing the Circus and called the Hut of Romulus. Those in charge of its care preserve its sanctity and resist improvements that would make it more stately. When the hut gets damaged by storm or routine wear, they replicate its earlier appearance as closely as possible.

    with the vice inherent in its setting. The theater, rightly seen, is
    a shrine to Venus. Indeed, this type of building came into the world in
    the name of Venus. For originally, even the heathen censors were concerned
    to destroy theaters as quickly as they arose, foreseeing the serious
    moral damage that would result from the licentious spirit of the
    theater. . . . Because of this attitude, when Pompey the Great (only his
    theater was greater than he!) had constructed that citadel of every vice
    and was afraid that because of this his memory might one day suffer
    from official censure, he added on to his theater a temple to Venus,
    and when he summoned the people to the dedication, he did not call
    the structure a theater, but a temple "to which we have added," he said,
    "some seating for shows."

    The scene itself of Caesar's death-struggle and assassination later
    made it clear to all that some spirit-power [daemon] had taken the event
    in hand to bring it about. For the meeting-site of the senate that day
    contained a statue of Caesar's late rival Pompey, which Pompey himself
    had dedicated as one more ornament to his theater. . . .
    Because Mark Antony was not only loyal to Caesar but physically
    powerful as well, the conspirators had arranged for Brutus Albinus
    to detain him outside in a lengthy conversation. Caesar himself, however,
    entered, and the senate rose in his honor. Some of the conspirators
    then moved into position behind Caesar's chair, while others, approaching
    him from the front as if in support of a petition being pleaded by
    Tillius Cimber on behalf of his exiled brother, gathered closely around
    Caesar's chair to argue the case. Sitting down, Caesar tried to brush
    them off, but they continued to harass him with their request until
    Caesar was driven to show some violence of temper. It was then that
    Tillius gave the signal to begin the attack, jerking Caesar's toga down
    from both his shoulders.
    Casca was the first to strike, stabbing Caesar in the neck with his
    dagger, but because he was understandably nervous about initiating a
    deed of such daring, the wound was neither deep nor deadly, and
    Caesar was able to turn around, grab the knife, and hold it away. . . .
    So the attack began. Those who were ignorant of the plot stood there
    in shock, neither fleeing nor coming to Caesar's defense with so much
    as a shout. Those in the know and intent on murder, however, all drew
    their knives in a ring around Caesar, so that whichever way he turned
    he was exposed to blades aimed at his face and eyes, trapped like an
    animal and struck by every hand.
    Since all of the conspirators had to take a part in the sacrifice, as
    it were, and to taste of Caesar's murder, Brutus also stabbed him once,
    in the groin. Some say that up until then Caesar was shouting and
    attempting to deflect and dodge the blows of the others but when he
    saw that Brutus too had drawn his sword, he pulled his toga over his
    head and sank down (whether by chance, or pushed there by his killers)
    at the base of Pompey's statue, spattering it with blood so that it
    seemed his former enemy in war stood over him in vengeance, with
    Caesar laid out at his feet quivering from his multitude of wounds. It is
    said he had been stabbed twenty-three times in all. Many of his assassins
    also received stab wounds, having struck one another by accident
    in their attempt to land so many blows on one body.

    Agrippa also completed the building called the Pantheon ["All-

    gods among the sculptures that adorned it, including those of Mars
    and Venus, but I personally think it is because the dome resembles the
    Heavens. Agrippa had intended to place a statue of Augustus there and
    to name the building after him, but when the emperor denied the honor,
    Agrippa placed a statue of Julius Caesar in it instead, while placing

    "ray of sunlight"].
    [The Egyptians worked out ways of transporting obelisks on the
    Nile.] A greater difficulty was faced by the Romans in transporting
    obelisks by ship to Rome, and the ships that did it were famous sights
    themselves. The emperor Augustus donated one such transport (the
    ship which carried the first of his two obelisks) for permanent display
    at a dock in Puteoli, but this has burnt. For several years Claudius preserved
    the boat which Caligula used for his obelisk, considering it the
    most amazing ship ever to float the oceans, but then constructed concrete
    piers on it (using the volcanic sand of Puteoli in the cement) and
    had it towed to Ostia and sunk to make part of his new harbor.
    Ships to transport these obelisks up the Tiber from the coast
    were a whole other challenge... .

    The obelisk that the emperor Augustus set up in the Circus Maximus
    was quarried by the king Psammetichus, who was ruling when
    Pythagoras visited Egypt. It is 85 1/2  feet tall, excluding its base, which is
    made from the same kind of granite. His obelisk in the Campus Manius
    is nine feet shorter, and was quarried by Sesoth. [Note: Pliny has his
    pharaohs reversed here.] The hieroglyphic inscriptions on both of them
    express the Egyptian philosophy of nature.
    The emperor Augustus used the obelisk in the Campus to construct
    a marvelous sun-dial, on which the shadow cast by the obelisk
    indicates the length of both days and nights, as marked out on the
    stone pavement built to measure it. The shadow on the shortest day of
    winter falls at the six-hour mark, and gradually shortens by an interval
    each day as the days grow longer (as marked out by bronze rods set in
    the pavement), after which the shadow lengthens again towards winter.
    It is altogether an object worthy of study, a creation of the
    mathematician Facundus Novus. He added a gold ball to the top of the
    obelisk, which gathered a clear shadow around it, otherwise diffused
    around the obelisk's tapering point-an idea, they say, which Facundus
    got from observing the shadow of the human head. These measurements,
    however, have been inaccurate for about thirty years now [due,
    Pliny speculates, to either solar changes, or a settling of the obelisk
    after earthquakes and floods].
    A third obelisk in Rome is in the Circus of Gaius and Nero. . . .
    We should mention in passing, since we speak of Egypt, the pyramids,
    those useless and idiotic displays of royal wealth... .

    believe as true the rumor that Antony, if he should defeat Augustus,
    would give Rome as a gift to Cleopatra, and transfer the seat of power
    to Egypt.

    Because the Romans regard with a religious reverence the
    grounds of the Campus Martius, they have built here the tombs of
    their most illustrious men and women. The most remarkable of these
    is the so-called Mausoleum, a great mound near the river ringed by a
    tall base of white stone and shaded by evergreens up to its crown.
    On the very top stands a bronze statue of Augustus Caesar. Beneath the
    mound are buried the remains of Augustus himself, his family, and his
    household. Behind the Mausoleum stretches a sacred grove with
    wonderful promenades,
    In the middle of the Campus another wall of white marble encloses
    the place of Augustus's cremation. A circular iron fence surrounds
    the wall, inside of which black poplars have been planted.

    Although limits were placed on the extent of his funeral honors,
    Augustus was eulogized twice: once by Tiberius in front of the Temple
    of Julius Caesar, and again by Tiberius's son Drusus on the old rostra.
    After this, he was carried to the Campus Martius on the shoulders of
    senators, and cremated there; nor was an ex-praetor lacking to swear
    he saw his image ascend from the funeral pyre into the sky. The leading
    men of the equestrian order, in bare feet and unbelted tunics,
    gathered up his bones and deposited them in the Mausoleum. Augustus
    built this monument between the Via Flaminia and bank of the Tiber
    in his sixth consulship [28 BC], and opened up the surrounding groves
    and walkways to the public.

    I, Augustus, built the following:
    the Senate House and [its annex] the Chalddicum (28 BC];
    the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, with porticoes (28 BC];
    the Temple of the Divine Julius [28 BC];
    the [shrine or grotto] of the Lupercal;
    the portico at the Circus Flaminius (which I let be named the Octavia,
    after Octavius, the builder of the earlier portico [167 BC] on the same
    site) [33 BC];
    the box-seat for the gods (pulvinar) at the Circus Maximus;
    the temples of Jupiter Feretrius and Jupiter theT hunderer [22 BC] on the
    Capitoline hill;
    the Temple of Quirinus (16 BC];
    the temples of Minerva [16 BC], Juno Regina, and Jupiter of Liberty on
    the Aventine Hill;
    the Temple of the Lares at the high point on the Sacred Way;
    the Temple of the Divine Penates on the Velia;
    the Temple of Youth,
    the Temple of the Great Mother on the Palatine.
    I restored the Capitoline Temple of Jupiter and the Theater of Pompey,
    both at great expense and without any inscriptional credits to myself on
    either building.
    I restored the aqueduct channels that were collapsing froin age In many
    places, and doubied the volume of the water called the Marcia by adding a new
    spring to its channel.
    I finished two works begun and nearly completed by my father: the Forum
    of Julius Caesar and the basilica [Julia] between the Temple of Castor and the
    Temple of Saturn. When the basilica burned down, i enlarged its site and began [in
    12 AD] to rebuild it in the name of my sons [Gaius and Lucius Caesar]; I ordered
    that the work be completed by my heirs, should I die first.
    I restored eighty two temples of the gods in Rome, by authority of
    the Senate in my sixth consulship [28 BC], overlooking none that needed to
    be restored.
    In my seventh consulship [27 BC] I restored the Via Flaminia from Rome to
    Rimini, and all of its bridges except the Milvian and Minucian.
    I built with war booty the Temple of Mars the Avenger and the Forum of
    Augustus [completed in 2 BC] on my own land.
    I built the Theater [11 BC] beside the Temple of Apollo, for the most part
    on ground that I purchased from private owners, and had it named after, Marcus
    Marcellus, my son-in-law.
    I dedictated gifts from war booty to the Capitolium, to the Temple of the
    Divine Caesar, to the Temple of Apollo, to the Temple of Vesta, and to the Temple
    of Mars Ultor their sum total was approximately 100,000,000 sesterces.

    [The Goths, under Vittigis, subjected Rome to a lengthy siege
    and fought several battles with the Romans, who were led by the
    famous general Belisarius.] One of the Gothic assaults [in AD 537]
    occurred in the following manner at the Porta Cornelia, just in front
    of the Aelian Bridge.
    Across the bridge, not more than a stone's throw outside this
    gate, stands the spectacular tomb of the Emperor Hadrian, made out
    of white marble from Paros that is fit together with such precision that
    no mortar was needed. It has four sides of equal length, again about
    the distance of a stone's throw; their height exceeds that of the city's
    defensive walls. On top of the tomb's outer walls, statues of men and
    horses are mounted, beautifully carved from the same white marble as
    the walls. Since it occurred to earlier inhabitants that the tomb might
    serve as an enemy fortress against the city (it does indeed look like a
    high tower built opposite the gate), they made it part of the city's defenses
    by extending two walls to it from the circuit walls [running from
    the sides of the tomb to the right bank?] ... .
    When the Goths made their assault, they mounted an attack at
    both this tomb and the Porta Cornelia. They had no siege engines, but
    carried numerous ladders and thought they could easily overwhelm
    the defenders with showers of arrows and then take the fortress without
    much trouble because it was undermanned. Equipped with long
    shields, the Goths advanced under the cover of the colonnade extending
    from the Aelian bridge to St. Peter's, thereby escaping the notice of
    the Romans until they were quite close to the tomb, where they sprung
    out and immediately began fighting. Their proximity took the Roman
    ballistae out of play (since these machines can only shoot horizontally)
    and the long shields of the Goths protected them from the
    defender's arrows. The Goths kept up their assault, sending out volley
    after volley, and were on the point of setting up their ladders. .. .
    For a short time the Romans were at a loss, unable to find a way
    to defend themselves. Then by mutual agreement they shattered most
    of the huge marble statues into hundreds of rocks, and began to hurl
    them down on the heads of the enemy. The Goths gave way under this
    barrage [and soon were routed].

    presiding over the Senate in session nearby at the Temple of Bellona.
    When Sulla heard the screams of the men being butchered with swords,
    he said to the terrified senators: "Let us continue our business, Senators;
    a few traitors are being executed by my orders."

    of earlier kings. Then for the first time the ground was marked out for
    the racetrack which is now called the Circus Maximus. Separate spaces
    for viewing were designated for the patricians and the knights, on stands
    propped twelve feet off the ground on wooden braces. Horses and boxers,
    drawn primarily from Etruria, provided the entertainment.
    Subsequently, these games, which are called both the Roman Games
    and the Great Games, have been held regularly each year.

    Tarquinius Priscus built the largest of the race-tracks, the one
    lying between the Aventine and Palatine hills, and was the first to erect
    covered seating there (until then the spectators had stood), which consisted
    of benches elevated on wooden scaffolding. He also divided the
    stands into thirty sections, one designated for each tribe, so that each
    person watched the games seated in his proper place.
    In time this structure was to grow into one of the most beautiful
    and impressive buildings in Rome. The arena is 2,100 feet long and
    400 feet wide. A trench for water, ten feet deep and ten feet wide, has
    been dug around it on the two longer sides and one of the shorter
    sides; behind this, stands of three stories are built. The ones at ground
    level have stone seats on a gradual incline, as in theaters; the upper
    stories are of wood. The stands extending down the two long sides of
    the track are joined together by stands that curve in a crescent around
    one of the short sides, in the manner of an amphitheater. This yields
    all told a seating area 4,800 feet long, with room for 150,000 spectators.
    The remaining short side, kept uncovered, has vaulted starting-gates
    which are all opened simultaneously by one rope.
    On the outer side of the Circus there is another portico, one-storied,
    containing shops with living-space above them. This portico
    also provides spectators access to the stands, with entrances and flights
    of stairs alongside each of the shops, such that the many thousands of
    spectators can enter and leave without inconvenience.

    in military dress, sets out to his command and to war, he declares his
    vows on the Capitoline. When the war is successfully completed, the
    victor returns to the Capitoline in his triumph, bringing well-deserved
    gifts to these same gods. The sacrificial animals that go before him in
    triumph are an important part of the triumph and make it clear that
    the general gives thanks to the gods for the success of his actions done
    in the interests of Rome's well-being."

    [The emperor Vespasian, with his sons Titus and Domitian, celebrated
    a triumph in AD 71 for victory in the First Jewish War, as
    described by the historian and Jewish priest Josephus:] Words cannot
    do justice to the multitude of amazing objects on display in a Roman
    triumph, or to their magnificence in the quality of the craftsmanship,
    in the variety of the valuables, or in their natural rarity. Almost everything
    wonderful and costly that a wealthy people manages to gather
    singly over a long time from various nations is here gathered
    together in abundance on one day to display the greatness of the
    Roman empire.
    In this triumph, the mass of silver, gold, and ivory, worked into
    every shape possible, was carried past in such profusion that it seemed
    to flow by like a river, along with woven cloth dyed the most precious
    purple or embroidered with the finest portraiture of Babylonian an.
    The sheer quantity of transparent gems on gold crowns and other
    objects brought reports of their rarity into doubt. The procession also
    included images of Roman gods, astounding for their size, carefully
    made and all of costly material. . . .
    Nothing, however, was more amazing than the contraptions of
    mobile stage-sets, many of which were so high-three or four stories that
    there was some fear of their toppling over as they moved along. . ..
    On these floats, the various episodes of the war were recreated with
    vivid clarity: one showed a prosperous countryside laid to waste, another,
    entire regiments slaughtered; here the natives fled, there they
    were led into captivity; towering walls demolished by siege-engines,
    strongholds captured, cities ringed with defenders overtaken as troops
    poured through the walls, the ground drenched in blood. Other floats
    showed the helpless raising their hands in supplication, temples set on
    fire, and houses pulled down on top of people still inside. . . .
    Such were the sufferings that awaited the Jews when they
    committed themselves to the war. The skill and magnificent scope of
    these stages rendered distant events present for those who had never
    been there. On each of the floats the general of a captured city was
    stationed in the manner he was taken. Many floats representing ships
    also followed.
    The spoils of the war were paraded past in great heaps. The most
    conspicuous spoils were those taken from the temple in Jerusalem.
    These included a gold table of great weight, and a lamp-stand likewise
    made of gold, but in a different design from the lamp-stands used in
    everyday life. For this lamp [the Menorah], a central shaft was attached
    to the base; slender branches extended from this, arranged in the manner
    of a trident, and at the end of each branch a bronze lamp was
    attached-seven in all, in accordance with the importance the Jews
    ascribe to this number.
    The last of the spoils paraded by was a copy of the Jewish law. . . .
    Then came Vespasian himself, followed by Titus and Domitian riding
    side-by-side. . . .
    The procession ended at the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter.
    Here they halted, in accordance with the ancient custom of waiting
    until someone brought word that the general of the enemy had been
    executed. This was Simon ben Giora, who had just been paraded among
    the captives. With a rope around his neck, he was tormented by his
    captors as they dragged him to the place alongside the Forum where by
    Roman law those sentenced to death are executed. At the announcement
    of his death, all cheered, and they began the sacrifices.

    Novissimum ab Sabinis bellum ortum, multoque id

    [This is how the name Tarpeian got attached to the Capitoline
    hill and the cliffs there. In response to Romulan Rome's abduction of
    women from surrounding tribes, Rome's neighbors mounted a series
    of attacks.] The last, and the fiercest by far, came from the Sabines. . .
    Spurius Tarpeius, the commander of the Citadel, had a daughter who
    was a Vestal Virgin. On one of her trips outside the walls to collect holy
    water at the Camenae springs, Tatius, the Sabine king, succeeded in
    bribing her with gold to open up the Citadel to the Sabine soldiers.
    As soon as they gained entrance, however, the Sabines crushed her to
    death beneath their shields, whether to make it look as if they took the
    Citadel by force, or to make an example of her treachery by showing
    that a traitor could safely trust no one.
    There is, however, another version of the story. In this, Tarpeia
    had stipulated as her reward whatever the Sabines wore on their left
    arms, with an eye on the massive gold armbands and the beautiful
    gem-studded rings they commonly wore; instead, she got their shields.
    There is also a third account, in which Tarpeia is a heroine: in this
    version, she made the pact for "what they wore on their left arms," and
    then surprised them by asking for their shields instead of the gold.
    When the Sabines perceived the trick, they destroyed her by giving her
    what she demanded.

    apart from the incredible shows he gave for the dedication ceremonies
    of the hunting theater [the Colosseum] and the baths that are named
    after him. One contest pitted whooping cranes against each other; in
    another four elephants fought. Animals both tame and wild were
    slaughtered, to the number of 9,000. Women (though none of any
    standing) took part in the killing; many men fought in single combat,
    but many others fought in squads, on both foot and in boats, since
    Titus had this same theater quickly flooded . . . Others also fought on
    boats in the basin in the Gardens of Gaius and Lucius [the Naumachia],
    which Augustus had excavated for just such battles. . . . Such spectacles
    lasted for one hundred days. Titus supplemented them with some more
    useful entertainment: he threw little wooden balls down on the audience
    of the amphitheater, each inscribed with a little picture of the
    prize that those who caught the balls could pick up from the appropriate
    officials: the prizes included food, clothing, vessels of silver and
    gold, horses, mules, cattle, and slaves.
    On the last day of his games, Titus was seen to weep. When they
    were over, he accomplished nothing great, dying the following year.

    schoolmates ran into him on their way back from lunch, and although
    he resisted and spoke strongly against joining them, they dragged him
    off with friendly force into the amphitheater on a day that featured
    cruel and mortal combat "Maybe you can drag my body into the sta
    dium," Alypius said, "but can you force my mind and eyes to attend
    such entertainment? I will be present, and yet absent, and so defeat
    both you and the games "
    When his friends heard this, they pulled him along wlth no less
    enthusiasm, perhaps eager to find out if he was able to make good on
    his boast By the time they were able to find seats, the crowd was In a
    state of brutal rapture Alypius shut tight the doors of his eyes, forbidding his mind from paying attention to such evils.  If only he could have sealed his ears! For when, in response to some knock-down in
    the arena, the giant roar of the entire crowd pounded on him, Alypius,
    overcome by curiosity but still confident that he could condemn and
    be the master of whatever he looked on, opened his eyes. Struck with a
    wound more deadly for his soul than for the body of the man who was
    the object of his sight, he fell, and fell more pitifully than that man
    whose fall occasioned the uproar. . . . For as soon as he saw the blood,
    he drank up the savagery, and did not then look away, but stared and
    swallowed the fury without knowing that he drank, thrilled by the crime
    of the combat and intoxicated by the bloodlust. No longer was he the
    person who had entered, but one of the crowd he had joined; he was
    now the true companion of those who had led him in.

    through the hills, laid beneath a suspended city, and even
    navigated by Agrippa when aedile [in 33 BC].
    Seven streams, collected into one channel, traverse the city, rushing
    like a mountain torrent and sweeping off everything in their path.
    When further swollen by a mass of rainwater, the currents pound the
    sides and bed of the channels, and when the Tiber on occasion floods
    and backs up into them, the waters inside clash from opposite directions;
    still the structures hold firm against the pressure. Floods might
    sweep away massive material above them, buildings collapse upon
    them, and earthquakes shake the earth around them, but the channels
    have endured 700 years since the time of Tarquinius Priscus and are

    everyone brought and tossed into the pit was able to fill it. Then they
    learned from an oracle of the gods that if they wanted the Republic of
    Rome to endure, they would have to sacrifice, on that spot, that which
    above all else made them strong.
    They then say that Marcus Curtius, an exceptional young
    soldier, criticized the others for doubting that Rome's strength could
    reside in anything other than the weapons and bravery of her citizens.
    Silence fell. Curtius, gazing up at the Capitolium and the temples that
    rise around the Forum, stretching his hands first to the heavens and
    then to the pit and the gods below, consecrated himself to the Underworld.
    Then, armed for battle and mounted on his horse in full
    caparison, Curtius leapt into the chasm, and the crowd of men and
    women threw gifts and fruits of the field in after him. Accordingiy, the
    Pool of Curtius is, they say, named for this Marcus Curtius, and not for
    the ancient Curtius Mettius, the Sabine soldier serving under Titus
    Tatius. In truth, the more recent event recounted here is the more prevalent
    story for the origin of the pool's name.

    [When he saw that the Roman troops under his command were
    losing a battle against the Latins south of Rome in 340 BC,] the consul
    Decius cried out to the pontifex: "Marcus Valerius, we need the help of
    the gods! As public pontiff of the Roman people, come and administer
    the oath with which I may devote myself to the Underworld in place of
    the legions." The pontiff told him to put on the purple-bordered toga,
    to extend a hand from under the toga to touch his own chin, and to
    repeat the following words while standing upon a spear that lay upon
    the ground: "Janus, Jupiter, Father Mars, Quirinus, Bellona, Lares, gods
    both local and foreign, to whose power both we and our enemies are
    subject, and you gods below, I beseech you with prayer and seek your
    favor with supplication: may you promote the might and victory of the
    Roman people and afflict the enemies of the Roman people with terror,
    panic, and death. In speaking these words, on behalf of the Republic
    of the Roman people, the army, its legions and its allies I hereby devote
    the legions and allies of the enemy, along with my own self, to the
    gods of the underworld and to Earth."
    Then Decius, with his toga draped in Gabine manner, jumped
    fully armed onto his horse and galloped off into the enemy's midst.
    To men on both sides he appeared to take on a more than human
    majesty, as if he were sent from heaven to expiate in full the anger of
    the gods and to turn destruction away from his own people and bring
    it upon the enemy. . . .
    The praise for victory in the battle went to the consuls, one of
    whom diverted towards himself alone all the menace and danger of
    the gods both above and below.

    Romulus appointed one hundred men as senators. [After Rome
    defeated the nearby city of Alba, c. 650 BC,] the king Tullus Hostilius
    selected the leading men of Alba for enrollment in the Roman Senate
    in order that this component of the republic might also grow. In addition
    to enlarging the senatorial order, he made the Senate House a
    ritually consecrated space; as a result, it was called the Curia Hostilia
    even into the times of today's senators.

    proved so advantageous to our country for so long. Certainly emperors
    may be found of both religions, of both beliefs; the earlier ones

    her power, who have not benefited so greatly from it. Do not reject the
    support of a divinity so conducive to triumphs. All of us are in debt to
    her efficacy; no one would deny that that which must be sought after
    must also be worshipped. But however unjust the refusal to worship
    this spirit, it is at least proper that the ornaments of the Senate House

    In measuring the hours of the day in Rome only the rising and
    setting of the sun are distinguished in the laws of the Twelve Tables
    [from the fifth century BC]. Years later, noon was also officially announced.
    This was done by an assistant of the consuls, who declared it
    noon when looking [south over the Comitia] from the Senate House
    he saw the sun positioned between the Rostra and the Graecostasis.
    When the sun passed to the Carcer side of the Column of Maenius, the
    assistant announced the final hour. Such reckoning (which was possible
    only on clear days) lasted down to the time of the First Punic
    War [264-241 BC].
    Varro reports that the first public sun-dial was erected during this
    war, and that it was located on a column next to the Rostra.
    Quintus Marcius Philippus, when censor [in 164 BC], later located a
    more accurate dial next to it. Even then, however, cloudy weather obscured
    the hours, until in the next census when Scipio Nasica was the
    first to reckon Rome's official time with a water clock that divided the
    days and night into equal hours. He dedicated this time-piece, lodged
    under a protective roof [in the Basilica Aemilia, according to Varro, LL

    quickly dividing up the entire empire as if divvying up ancestral

    of contention. At first the desire of each man both to kill his enemies

    their anger against those they hated won out over concern for family
    and friends, and Octavian let Antony have Cicero. ... When the three of

    (The Herakleidai) of Pamphilos : Pamphilos
    was a painter, who depicted the
    Herakleidai supplicating the people of
    Athens. . . . . this story mas represented by
    the painter Pamphilos; according to some,
    however, Pamphilos as a tragic poet, who
    dramatized the fortunes of the Herakleidai.
    Another version: Kallistratos and Euphronios say that Pamphilos was a writer
    of tragedies and produced a Herakleidai.
    But the most carefully written commentaries
    express doubt whether he was a Tragic
    poet or a painter who, they say, was
    Apelles' teacher. In the lists of plays there
    is certainly no mention of a Pamphilos as
    a tragic poet before this time. There is
    indeed a painting of the Herakleidai and
    Alkmene and the daughter of Herakles
    coming as suppliants to the Athenians in
    fear of Eurystheus; this painting is not as
    people say by Pamphilos, but by Apollodoros.
    Pamphilos, it appears, was later in
    date than Aristophanes.
    Another version: This man was a writer
    of tragedy; he represented the Herakleidai
    holding suppliant branches. . . . .
    What happened to them was depicted
    by Pamphilos, an Athenian painter, in the
    stoa of the Athenians; he showed them in
    the act of supplication. What Aristophanes
    means is that those who are facing an
    adverse judgment accompanied by their children and wives ask to be acquitted of the charge.

    As you go to the stoa which is called Poikile
    because of the pictures, there is a
    bronze Hermes called Agoraios, and a gate
    near by. On the gate is a trophy erected by
    the Athenians when in a cavalry fight they
    defeated Pleistarchos, who was the brother
    of Kassandros and was entrusted with the
    command of his cavalry and mercenaries.
    This stoa contains, firstly, the Athenians
    arrayed at Oinoe in the Argive territory
    against the Lacedaemonians.  What is depicted is not the moment at which the
    struggle has reached its height and the action
    has advanced to the display of deeds
    of daring, but the beginning of the battle
    with the combatants still coming to grips.
    On the middle part of the walls are the
    Athenians and Theseus fighting with the
    Amazons. . . . .
    After the Amazons are the Greeks when
    they have taken Troy, and the kings assembled
    on account of the reckless behavior
    of Ajax toward Kassandra and other captive women.  The last part of his shield cannot have been seen by Pausanias; the cistern was filled up long before his time.  One can hardly hope that this is the shield of Brasidas.
